<h3> About me </h3>
<p> I am a second year student  reading for a degree in Maths and Philosophy at the University of Oxford. </p>
<p> I grew up in Portugal and moved to the UK to study. </p>
<p> I would like to pursue a career in philosophy, with a focus on philosophy of mind in the context of scientific discoveries. I also hope to continue to do work and advocacy in the area of Effective Altruism. </p>
<p> In my free time, I enjoy running, going to hipster gigs, baking, and drinking with friends (more often than not, tea). </p>
